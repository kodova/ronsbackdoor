# Woods Canyon Lake

If I could pick any lake here in AZ to get hitched to it would be this lake.  I keep my fishing boat up here all year that's how much I love this lake. Caught my 28in 3lb brown trout on still afternoon in September...

 It wasn't such a still afternoon the day before in the valley.  Seems I had put the horse before the wagon.  So I found myself on another "get the heck outta Dodge" trips.  The weather is always nice up on the Rim.  I have a custom tent that has a backdoor entrance so I can take in all the beauty, sounds, and breeze the moutain air offeres.

 I woke up ealy that morning.  Something is the air said "today is the day".  Excitedly I threw my gear on and headed out the backdoor.  Spent most of the morning switching out flies to find the perfect monster catcher.  Nyphms, buzzers, wooly boogers... nothing seemed to get a good strike.  I realized just after eating my ham and cheese on rye sandwich that was September!  I ruffled through my flybox and there it was... my prized mayfly fly.  Sinched that sucker up on line and started casting.  I was in the flow, Bad Moon Rising by CCR played in my head; I was one with the rod.

 BOOM! The trout struck that fly like it hadn't eaten in a week.  The fight was one.  He tried to go under a log, then under boat but I was too quick that day.  A leap out of the water trying to release the hook that was leading him to his destiny of wall mount.  That's right he was my holy grail of fish that day my friends.  I couldn't believe the line held.  I got him in the boat, winded from our fierce battle but estatic I finally caught the biggest trout of my life.

 "Brownie" as I call him now resides on my wall as a reminder of that fateful awesome day.
