I like to fish.  I also like a good trip out in mother nature.  It just so happens I particularly enjoy doing both at the same time... FISHING TRIP!!!

And so it was, on this particular day I set out on a journey...off to do some sole searching.  I decided to try some new territory, deep into the forest I went.  Indeed, it was a perilous journey, fraught with many laden obstacles in my way.
Undaunted, I ventured forward...deep into the unknown woods...ranging for the river.

Dark and full of terrors the path was, but I pressed forward...in search of adventure, and adventure I found.
Of this journey I have many tails, perhaps I'll share those details another day, but alas, this post is like me... all about the bass, no trouble.

As I always say, in order to be a true, bone-fide fishing master... one need only master the following key skills:
- Jerking Your Bait
- Wiggling Your Worm
- Bending Your Rod

I like it when she bends over, but I love it when she tugs on my worm and then swallows!!!
Ah sweet victory!!

A reel expert can tackle anything, and here's the proof:

Like I always say, if you're good with your rod...the fish will come.

Mine's so big...even this Master Baiter has to use two hands (or more)...

Stay thirsty my friends
