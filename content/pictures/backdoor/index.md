I have always loved the outdoors and often find myself camping in a popup tent on the weekends. It's been my dream to retire and make my fishing trips a weekly activity instead of a monthly one. With many more years of work ahead me I have kept this as a distant dream for years. Then one day I came out, through the backdoor, to harvest some cucumbers for later that night. I looked up and right there in the middle of my subaran backyard I saw an owl perched on top of a light post and then it came to me, “are owls birds?”, of course they are, why would I even question that. I told my wife of the stupid owl question I just asked myself and she seemed to ignore the stupid thought and was more interested in the owl itself. This is when she uttered the phrase, "The outdoors can be right out the backdoor" and it resonated with me. Taking my knowledge in technology I built a site to start capturing the wilderness right at my backdoor. I did get a photo of it.
