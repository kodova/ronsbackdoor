As you can see, I have the best garden in town. It's easily accessible from my backdoor. It's lush and produces lots of vegetables. A lot of people ask me Ron how do you keep your back door garden looking great. Well, the main tip is to make sure the soil is moist and to shove your seeds in as deep as you can.

I'm really proud of this year's harvest. They say a normal-size cucumber plant produces an edible fruit up to 16in in length. As you can see in the above image, my cucumbers were nice and large. I was happy to take them in my back door for my wife to see.
